\section{Master equation}

\[ \dot \rho = -i [H, \rho] + \mathcal{D}[\sqrt{\kappa}L]\rho \]

where the last term can be written as $\mathscr{L}\rho$

\[ \mathcal{D}[A] = A\rho A^{\dagger} - \frac{1}{2} \{ A^{\dagger}A\rho  \}  \]

We have to assume that the bath as no memory. The reason we model the bath as a lot of oscillators is that linear system are linear and dont remember how they got there.

We make the Markovian approximation :$\dot \rho$ only depends on $\rho(t)$ and not $\rho(t'<t)$

We also assume that the system is a state is a product state at every time.


Shrodinger equation matrix density flavor


\[ \dot \rho = -i [H, \rho]  \]

We got to the interaction frame with 

\[ U(t) = e^{i(H_{\text{sys}} + H_{\text{B}} )} \]
